# Storybranch
#### By Jerome Bawa.

Storybranch is a React-based application for managing and visualizing story timelines. It provides a user-friendly interface to create, edit, and organize nodes within a timeline, allowing users to manage complex story structures efficiently.

This application streamlines the process of creating and managing story timelines, making it easier for writers, game developers, and other creatives to visualize and organize their stories. With features like text editing, timeline management, and quick access to frequently used actions, Storybranch provides a comprehensive solution for managing story timelines.


For instance, writers can use Storybranch to create and organize the plot points of their stories while game developers can use it to manage the branching paths and narrative elements of their games. This could be also be used to help map out games with multiple endings or branching paths, especially in narrative-driven games such as Telltale's The Walking Dead or Life is Strange.
